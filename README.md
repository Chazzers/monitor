## Concept - Racial profiling in numbers

"Racial profiling in numbers" visualizes the data of surveys that have been taken by the citizens of Amsterdam. The results of the surveys bring new insights to the amount of racial profiling that's taking place in Amsterdam. In this project there are a lot of visualisations that explain the gravity of racial profiling in Amsterdam

## Data

By using the results of the survey, numerous calculations have been made in Microsoft Excel which have been manually transformed into JS objects. These objects are then intrepreted by D3.js to make data-visualisations.
